                        At my first math competition in 2011 I was able to only answer the following question:

                        Needless to say I didn't get past that first round.

                    <p>
                        A year later I came across a notebook from a former math competitor from which 
                        I learned how to mimick proof writing. 
                        That notebook got me past that first round after which I met the person they called "Sef"(Shef).
                        With his guidance I passed all the way to the state competition where I fell short.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2013 I passed the state junior TST and got my first bronze medal at the Junior Balkan Math Olympiad in Turkey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two years later I passed to the International Math Olympiad and got my first IMO bronze medal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two years later I went to my final International Math Olympiad in the beautiful Rio de Janeiro,
                        winning my third bronze medal. It was here that I realized how beautiful 
                        this opportunity to do math competitions is. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My bronze medal got me into an Ivy League school which I started in September 2017.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In September 2020 I decided to start Shefs of Problem Solving to, among other things, give you a roadmap from 0 to the IMO.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now I decided to take it a step further by introducing Shef's Scholars.

            <h2>
                ‚öóÔ∏èThe Secret to an IMO medal
            </h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Over my time as a math competitor, I've learned a lot about what it 
                    takes to get to and perform well in math competitions. </p>
                <p>I've talked to a lot of competitors about their thinking, 
                    trying to see if there is an algorithm for solving problems 
                    they have that I don't or some secret to better performance.</p>
                <p>As far as I can tell, it's implausible to try to come up with
                    a descriptive universal algorithm for solving general competitive
                    math problems.
                </p>
                <p>But there are certain heuristics or rules of thumb to follow when 
                    solving problems like:
                    <ul class="smaller-font" style="line-height: .8em;">
                        <li>exploring the problem</li>
                        <li>playing around with
                            small cases</li>
                        <li>looking for patterns in small cases</li>
                        <li>guessing the 
                            solution or construction</li>
                        <li>starting simple before moving onto complexity</li>
                        <li>being flexible with your approaches</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </p>
                <p>and many more</p>
                <p>All of these heuristics take a ton of time and practice to 
                    truly master.
                </p>
                <p>You can definitely do all the practice by yourself and get yourself to
                    the IMO and potentially even win a medal.
                </p>
                <p>However, a mentor who has gone down the same path as you can greatly help you with the selection of practice problems.
<!--                     At the same time, having a mentor who has gone through what you're going
                    through can help shorten the search for problems that you should solve
                    next. -->
                </p>
                <p>On top of that, having a community of competitors from around the world
                    can motivate you to get better.
                </p>
                <p>You can learn a lot about your own problem solving by talking to other
                    problem solvers about their approaches to problems.
                </p>
                <p>Before the Internet, you would've needed to be very lucky to be born in a 
                    place where there are a lot of math competitors around.
                </p>
                <p>Today, and hopefully with Shef‚Äôs Scholars, that need no longer be a requirement
                    for success.

                        A natural question to ask yourself when something seems too good to be true is "What's the catch?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well the first catch is that there is an actual application I will review that may end up being competitive so there are no guarantees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though if I had infinite time, I'd probably choose everyone who is motivated enough and there are a bunch of reasons for that.

                        Here is what I'm getting out of giving you my time for free:
                        <ul>
                            <li>I'm advertising my Youtube channel and helping it grow</li>
                            <li>I'm building up credibility in future instances of this program by helping some of you achieve some levels of success</li>
                            <li>I get to work with young motivated individuals who could become future collaborators in research or industry work</li>
                            <li>I am able to test whether or not this idea works at all and determine if it's a good use of my time going forwards</li>
                            <li>If this does work out, I can fit it in my schedule, and it brings enough traction to the Youtube channel I can build a new source of income</li>
                            <li>I might be able to host exclusive content on this platform and charge a fee for that in the future</li>
                            <li>I want to build something and I can get people interested by making it free in the first edition</li>
                            <li>Making it free NOW could generate scarcity which could drive interest </li>
                            <li>I generally like teaching and the dynamic nature of working on someone's skill in this</li>
                            <li>I might meet people who are interested in being mentors in future iterations of this</li>
