                            I felt like I learned a lot of tricks and tips in combinatorics which encouraged me to do some imo sl problems 
                            I think the way of taking lessons from IMO champion is just different from others because you get lessons by deeply experienced person.
                            We socialized by each other we learned by mistakes in our solutions which is different than getting lesson and explanetion by someone else (the group consists only imo level students which is good for improving)
                            I got selected for summer camp for imo (which is due to my imo score top 20)
                            If you want to stduy individual and got help by experienced olympians it would be great
                            and taking lectures is the best way to study.
                            I wish i take program again :)"</p>

Shef gave a lot of problem sets and also organized meetings to correct these problems in group, which definitely gave useful insights as to how one should tackle a math olympiad problem. Furthermore he organizes some one-on-one meetings in which I had the choice of going over any math question I wanted. The real perk of Shef Scholars is in my opinion just the way Salko explain his mathematics. He's a fantastic teacher and will give you just the right amount of help and insights to solve problems. What I improved the most, other than just overall better problem-solving skills, is endurance, i.e. wanting to solve the problem, rather than solving it as quickly as possible. I definitely recommend this program to any student who aspires to become a better problem-solver."</p>

                        To be a Shef Scholar and join our Competitive Math Academy you need to have a decent foundation in mathematics. If you are able to solve at least 50% of the problems from the beginner reference problems, you are qualified to be a Shef Scholar and join the Shef Scholars Competitive Math Academy. Anything less than that and you are not ready for the program yet.

                        Students are placed into tracks based on their preferences, test evaluations, and in some cases interviews. 
                        We suggest you look at the reference problems and apply to the track in which you can solve 50% of the reference problems. Do not worry too much about picking the right track. If we believe you've misplaced yourself, we can suggest a move to another track in which you will find the most growth in.
