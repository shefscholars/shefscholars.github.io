                        We work with schools, school districts, colleges and universities, local, state, and federal
                        government agencies, businesses, and other organizations to provide programs such as tutoring,
                        test preparation, and college admission counseling. Your organization may arrange for your
                        participation in these programs and negotiate a special price or trial offer, or purchase (or
                        subsidize) products or services on your behalf. We may share your personal and non-personal
                        information that we collect through your participation in these programs (such as test scores,
                        transcripts or recordings of online tutoring and online class sessions, comments you leave in
                        post-session surveys, and details regarding your usage of our programs) with the organization
                        arranging for your access to these programs or with your parents or guardians. In addition, your
                        school may require us to share such information with others legally entitled to access your
                        academic records, such as your state department of education. If you use a promotion code at our
                        Site to create an account or add products or services, we may let the source of that promotion
                        code know that you used that code.

                        You may authorize another person to act as your agent to submit requests on your behalf. Unless

                        provide the agent a written and signed authorization. You may also submit requests on behalf of

                        will ask you to enter your username and password through a link we provide to verify your
                        identity. If you do not have an account with us, we will ask you to provide us data points that
                        we have about you to verify your identity.</p>
                    <p>If you authorize another person to act as your agent to submit requests on your behalf, then
                        unless you provide the agent with power of attorney under the California Probate Code, we will
                        ask the agent to provide us the written and signed authorization that you provided to the agent,
                        we will confirm with you that you did provide the authorization, and we will verify your
                        identity. If you submit a request on behalf of a minor child, we will ask you to provide us
                        information about your child that allows us to determine that you are the parent or guardian of
                        the child. If the child is under the age of 13, we will ask you to sign a form declaring under
                        penalty of perjury that you are the parent or guardian of the child.</p>
                    <h3>Our Response to Your Request</h3>

                        we require more time (up to 45 additional days), we will inform you of the reason in
                        writing.&nbsp; We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically.&nbsp; If we are
                        unable to comply with a request, our response will explain why.</p>
                    <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is
                        excessive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell
                        you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your
                        request.</p>
